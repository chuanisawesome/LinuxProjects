# NTI-310

We are building on existing Linux automation and configuration skills from NTI-300. In this class we are introduced to Product Data/Product Lifecycle Management tools, custom code compilation and package creation. Which includes administering, patching, and updating various development, testing, and production versions of server services. 

For this project I used Gcloud to spin up my instances. I was able to spin-up 4 servers (ldap, nfs, postgres, and django) and 2 client (ldap and nfs).
